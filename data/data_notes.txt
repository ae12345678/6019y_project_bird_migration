#Data notes
some data, will not be made available on github, due to size or terms of use of the data.
data folders that cannot be seen are "ebird" and "nabbs". due to how the code is done, these need to contain the appropriate data, with "ebird" containing the "ebd_US_relJan_2023.txt" dataset, and the "nabbs" folder containing the "2022Release_Nor.zip" unpacked.
