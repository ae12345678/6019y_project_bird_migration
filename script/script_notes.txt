#Script notes
scripts are to be stored in this folder, referencing data in the data folder's subfolders.
script titles are formatted "data_aaa_bbb". "aaa" referencing the data predominantly used, and "bbb" referencing purpose.
the depricated folder contains scripts that no longer are needed for the rest of the data.
